 Geo3D
Geo3D is an ReShade 5.3+ addon for geometric 3D using SBS etc
Development started 2022 but in its current incarnation it is just about a year old.
It supports DX9-DX12 but the main focus is on DX12.
It uses alternative frame rendering.
This means motion blur should be avoided.
After heavy development I have reached v1.2.5.
