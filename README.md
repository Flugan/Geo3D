# Geo3D Installer
Helps manage Geo3D installations in the specified game. Steam and Epic Game Store should be handled automatically. Other games need to be handled through PATHs.txt and FOLDERs.txt

I store games in c:\SSD and d:\SSD
Epic in separate folder d:\Epic since it's picked up by epic manifests.

I only have 1TB + 2TB M.2 SSDs so games need to rotate.
Good thing that I recently got 1 gigabit internet.
